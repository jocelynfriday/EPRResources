A collection of resources, both papers and websites, that I've found useful when working with UK electronic patient records (EPR).

<summary><b><i>Scottish Morbidity Records (SMR)</i></b></summary>
Scottish Morbidity Records are Tier 1 datasets, meaning data are collated at a national level and contain information from everyday care. These datasets contain individual-level healthcare data for patients treated within Scotland. The type of record denotes the general type of healthcare received and/or the patient's medical status.

<summary>SMR01</summary>
SMR01 contains information regarding all general and acute inpatient and day cases from all NHS hospitals in Scotland. Each row of data corresponds to an episode of care. Patients receive a new episode of care each time they change specialty, significant facility[^1], or consultant for medical reasons.

The first nine characters of the BNF code specify the chemical level of the medication. Within these nine characters, the first two characters indicate the chapter of the BNF that the medication is from. For example, drugs in BNF Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular System) will always begin with `02'. The code is then further subdivided into sections (e.g., Diuretics, contained within Chapter 2 Section 2 of the BNF, all begin with `0202'). The remaining six characters provide more detailed information about the medication, including whether the product is branded or generic, its strength, and formulation (see Figure \ref{fig:bnfCode} for a breakdown of a 9-character BNF code).
